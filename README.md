# SecurityGuardAPI Workspace

An enterprise-grade, hardened gateway built on **.NET 10** designed for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. It implements an OAuth2-style `client_credentials` grant flow to issue signed JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and exposes fully insulated endpoints intended for secure webhook integrations (such as Zapier).

---

## 🏗️ Workspace Architecture

The repository is structured as a unified multi-project workspace to completely isolate production application binaries from the testing framework, avoiding implicit compilation/file-globbing errors.

🛡️ Security Hardening Principles

This gateway is explicitly engineered against common automated exploit vectors:

    Constant-Time Verification Mechanisms: Credential checking utilizes direct key lookup algorithms to neutralize microsecond-level timing anomalies, preventing brute-force timing analysis enumeration.

    Non-Disclosure Error Topography: Error responses throw perfectly identical payloads and generic HTTP status descriptions whether a client ID is unrecognized or a secret is incorrect, closing user-enumeration disclosure doors.

    Insulated Runtime Middleware: The execution pipeline rejects unsigned, mutated, or missing bearer authorizations directly at the protocol layer before routing hits application-level code.

🚀 Installation & Local Deployment
System Requirements

    .NET 10.0 SDK or newer

    A command-line terminal environment (bash, zsh, etc.)

1. Clone & Environment Initialize

Step into your local deployment workspace and clean-restore code assembly dependencies:
Bash

cd ~/SecurityGuardWorkspace
dotnet restore

2. Verify Infrastructure Stability

Execute the automated test suite against the built-in mock web host to ensure authorization gates respond correctly under simulated attacks:
Bash

dotnet test SecurityGuardAPI.Tests/SecurityGuardAPI.Tests.csproj

3. Launch the API Service

Fire up the local engine pipeline:
Bash

dotnet run --project SecurityGuardAPI/SecurityGuardAPI.csproj

The application will boot up and bind to standard development ports (typically http://localhost:5000 or https://localhost:5001). Check terminal output logs to confirm binding routes.
🚦 Endpoint Specifications & Usage Manual

The lifecycle of an ingestion session consists of two stages: Authentication followed by Resource Consumption.
Phase 1: Exchanging Credentials for an Access Token

To hit the system, an integration client must pass their provisioned ID and secret to the public auth router.

    Endpoint: POST /api/auth/token

    Headers: Content-Type: application/json

 
 
 
 
 JSON Payload Matrix:

JSON

{
  "clientId": "your_allowed_client_id",
  "clientSecret": "your_assigned_cryptographic_secret",
  "grantType": "client_credentials"
}



Verification Execution Example (curl):
Bash

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/token \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"clientId":"zapier_integration_node","clientSecret":"super_secure_vault_pass_123","grantType":"client_credentials"}'


     
     Success Response Pipeline (200 OK):
JSON

{
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "tokenType": "Bearer",
  "expiresIn": 3600
}



Phase 2: Utilizing the Secure Data Gateway

Once you harvest an active token string, assign it to your payload headers to safely transition past the gateway boundary.

    Endpoint: POST /api/zapier/receive

    Headers: * Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>

        Content-Type: application/json

    JSON Payload Matrix: Any structured business event or transactional package array.


    
    Verification Execution Example (curl):
Bash

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/zapier/receive \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"event":"lead_created","email":"prospect@domain.com","status":"active"}'


     
     
     Expected Ingestion Handshake (200 OK):
JSON

{
  "message": "Data integrated safely under JWT shield."
}









🚦 Gateway Rejection Matrix

If incoming operational parameters step outside strict cryptographic criteria, the application forces defensive handling states.
Condition	                       HTTP Status	          System Response Payload Reason
Missing/Mismatched grantType	  400 Bad Request	      {"error":"unsupported_grant_type","error_description":"..."}
Corrupt or Unknown Credentials	  401 Unauthorized	     {"error":"invalid_client","error_description":"..."}
Missing or
Blank Authorization Header	      401 Unauthorized	      Handled at transport boundary before executing routing modules.
Altered/Fake/Malformed JWT	      401 Unauthorized	      Handled via framework level validation middleware.
